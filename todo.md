# TODO list before releasing beta:
* in lists, you can do `[1, 2,  *[3, 4, 5]]`, but you can't do `[1, 2, *foo_list]`. That's annoying...
* fix #6
* do all the TODOs in the code (with the pretty good PyCharm 'TODO' tab)
* finish `test_file.noug`
* write CONTRIBUTING.md

# TODO list during beta:
* add attributes (or maybe not?...)
